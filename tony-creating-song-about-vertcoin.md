Track duration ~ 3minutes.

1. The cost of creating an author's instrumental from my beatmaker will be $100. All copyrights to music pass to the customer.
2. I ask for $700 for writing the text, travel time and participation in the recording of the track at the studio.
3. A trip to a recording studio in St. Petersburg - $450 (this amount includes the purchase of train tickets from my city to St. Petersburg and back ($190); payment for a taxi from the station to the studio, payment for a taxi from the studio to the hotel, payment for a taxi from hotel to the station ($65), hotel ($135), payment for food and water ($60).
4. The cost of recording in the studio and mastering the track will cost $90.
Result - $1340


Prepayment is 50%. After receiving an advance payment, I order an instrumental from a beatmaker and expect to receive a music file within 5-7 days.
As soon as I get an instrumental, I immediately start writing lyrics. This process usually takes 1-3 days.
After the lyrics are written, I will need time to rehearse the track. This stage takes up to 1-2 days.
Then you make the second part of the payment in the amount of the remaining amount and I book a studio, book a hotel, buy train tickets.
Departure is carried out within 1-2 days.
The train ride to St. Petersburg takes 16 hours. I arrive in the evening in the city and go to the hotel. The next day I go into the studio and record stuff, then I go to a hotel for the night.
The next day I return to my hometown and wait for the finished track from the sound engineer. This stage takes up to 5 days.
I receive the track and send it to the customer with full transfer of all copyrights.

If it doesn't matter, then I can use the instrumental from free access (free) and thus the final price will be lower by $100.
